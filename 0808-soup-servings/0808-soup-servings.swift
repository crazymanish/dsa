// Time Complexity: O(1)
// The input `n` is effectively capped at 4800. Any `n` larger than this returns 1.0 immediately.
// For `n <= 4800`, the complexity is determined by the number of states in our DP table.
// After scaling `n` down by 25, the number of states is roughly (4800/25)^2 â‰ˆ 192^2,
// which is a constant number of calculations. A more descriptive complexity, if `n` were unbounded,
// would be O((N/25)^2) or simply O(N^2).
//
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// For the same reason, the space for the DP cache is bounded by a constant size: (192+1) x (192+1).
// If `n` were unbounded, the complexity would be O(N^2) for the cache.
