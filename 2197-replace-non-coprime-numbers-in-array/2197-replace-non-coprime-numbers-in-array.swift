// Time Complexity: O(N * log K)
//   - N: The number of elements in the input array `nums`.
//   - K: The maximum value of a number in the `nums` array.
//   - The algorithm iterates through each of the N numbers once.
//   - For each number, it may enter a `while` loop that merges it with previous
//     elements. However, each number can be pushed onto the `result` stack once and
//     removed once. This leads to an amortized O(N) complexity for the push/pop logic.
//   - Inside the loop, we call the `gcd` function. The Euclidean algorithm's complexity
//     is logarithmic with respect to the smaller of its inputs, O(log K).
//   - Therefore, the total time complexity is O(N * log K).
//
// Space Complexity: O(N)
//   - In the worst-case scenario (if all numbers are coprime with their neighbors), the
//     `result` array will store all N numbers. Thus, the space required is
//     proportional to the input size.

     * Replaces adjacent non-coprime numbers in an array with their LCM until no such pairs exist.
     *
     * The problem requires us to repeatedly find the *leftmost* adjacent non-coprime pair
     * and replace it with its LCM. A naive approach of scanning and modifying the array would be
     * inefficient (O(NÂ²)).
     *
     * A more efficient strategy is to use a stack-like approach. We build a `result` array
     * by processing one number at a time from the input. When we add a new number, we
     * check if it's non-coprime with the last number already in `result`. If it is, we
     * merge them (by replacing them with their LCM) and repeat the check with the new
     * merged number and the element now at the end of `result`. This continues until the
     * end of the `result` array is stable (i.e., the last two elements are coprime).
     *
     * - Parameter nums: An array of integers.
     * - Returns: The final array after all non-coprime merges are complete.
