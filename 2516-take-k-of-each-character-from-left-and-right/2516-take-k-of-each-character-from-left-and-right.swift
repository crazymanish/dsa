Plan:
Count Total Characters: Count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the entire string to ensure you have at least 2 * k of each character. If not, return -1.

Sliding Window Technique: Use a sliding window to find the smallest substring that can be removed so the remaining part of the string has at least k of each character on both ends.

Maintain Character Counts: Keep track of the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the substring and dynamically adjust the counts when expanding or shrinking the window.

Calculate Minimum Length: Iterate through the string and calculate the minimum length of the removable substring.

Step-by-Step Execution:
Input:
takeCharacters("aabaaaacaabc", 2)

Step 1: Count Characters
Total counts are:
'a': 7
'b': 2
'c': 3

Step 2: Check Feasibility
Since all counts are greater than or equal to 2 * k = 4, proceed.

Step 3: Sliding Window
Initialize minLength = 12 (length of the string), left = 0, and currentCount = [0, 0, 0].
Expand right pointer to include characters in the window and adjust currentCount.

Step 4: Shrinking the Window
Shrink the window from the left when conditions are met, and update minLength:
At right = 5, the window is "aabaaa". Counts [4, 1, 0].
Shrink to "aabaa" â†’ Update minLength = 6.

Repeat until the smallest removable substring is found.

Result:
Minimum removable substring length is 3.

Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), as we traverse the string with a sliding window.
Space Complexity: O(1), only using fixed arrays for counts.

This approach efficiently calculates the desired result by combining counting and sliding window techniques.
